# ROT13_Encoder-Decoder-using-Python

This is a simple Python program that allows you to either convert or decode text using the ROT13 cipher.

ROT13 is a simple substitution cipher that replaces each letter in the alphabet with the letter 13 places ahead or behind it, wrapping around to the beginning of the alphabet if necessary. 
This means that A is replaced with N, B with O, and so on, up to M, which is replaced with Z. After that, the letters wrap back around to the beginning of the alphabet, so N is replaced with A, O with B, and so on, up to Z, which is replaced with M.

Note: Special characters and numbers are ignored in ROT13.
